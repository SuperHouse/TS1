Touch Switch 1
==============
Copyright 2018-2019 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd  www.superhouse.tv  

A simple single-channel touch switch controller with a switchmode
power supply and a linear regulator, to allow operation or input
voltages up to 28V such as a wheelchair battery.

Deliberately de-sensitised to require actual contact with the
touch pad, to prevent false triggering when a finger is held
near the pad without touching it.

Open-drain output that switches to GND via an N-MOSFET.

Features:

 * at42qt1010 touch sensor IC
 * 7-28Vdc supply voltage
 * Open-drain output
 * Power LED
 * Activity LED
